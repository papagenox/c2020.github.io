# Computer Fundamentals & Programming

Course Description

This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the C programming language.
